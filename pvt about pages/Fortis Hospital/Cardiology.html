                </div>

                <p>Cardiology is a medical discipline related to the examination and treatment of the blood vessels and
                    the heart. The practitioner dealing with such ailments and the required treatments is known as a
                    cardiologist. This domain falls under internal medicine. It is imperative to know that a
                    cardiologist is different from a cardiac surgeon. A cardiologist specializes in the diagnosis and
                    treatment of the diseases in the cardiovascular system. The cardiologist has a range of tests at his
                    / her disposal like angioplasty, pacemaker insertion, and cardiac catheterizations. While heart
                    diseases only refer to the heart, a cardiovascular disease refers to either the heart, the blood
                    vessels or both, and Fortis Kolkata specializes in both, making it one of the <strong>best heart
                        hospitals in Kolkata.</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Department</strong></p>

                <p>Although in most cases, the general practitioner refers to the cardiologist only if required, but if
                    you notice any of the below signs / symptoms, it is advised to seek professional guidance:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Shortness of breath</li>
                    <li>Dizziness</li>
                    <li>Pain in the chest</li>
                    <li>Fluctuating heart rate and / or rhythm</li>
                    <li>High BP</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Usually, a cardiologist listens to the murmur of the heart and / or abnormal rhythm to determine a
                    condition. If you are looking for a<strong>Ã‚&nbsp;best cardiologist in Kolkata</strong>, look no
                    further than Fortis Kolkata.</p>
