        <p>A common olfactory-related question that is often overlooked:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Why can't I smell that?</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The most common causes of olfactory disorders are nasal and/or sinus disease, viral upper respiratory infections, and head trauma. The most common causes of taste disorders are upper respiratory tract infections and head injuries. Other infrequent causes of both include masses in the nasal or oral passageways, endocrine problems, side effects from medications, and degenerative processes of the brain.</p>
        
        <p>Proper airflow through the nasal airway is extremely important. The air that passes through the nose and reaches the lungs must be suitably warmed and clean. The physiological filtration of the nose is an important function so the lungs or pulmonary system may work at their best and also promote one's overall good health. Without good nasal breathing, a host of medical problems may occur. The importance of consistent nasal breathing has been noticed with individuals who have had successful corrective nasal septoplasty.</p>
        
        <p>THE MOST COMMON NASAL CONDITIONS</p>
        
        <p><strong>Chronic sinusitis:</strong> Chronic sinusitis is a condition that occurs as a result of recurring infections or inflammation in the sinuses. It is almost always treated with oral medications, however there are situations when surgery is necessary.</p>
