                    heart disease are the leading cause of death for men and women in every part of the globe. At
                    Narayana Health, India’s best heart hospital we specialise in the treatment of <a
                        href="https://www.narayanahealth.org/heart-disease/" style="color:#f06850;">heart disorders</a>
                    and ailments, making sure that all your cardiological needs are taken care of with the best-in-class

                <h3>At Narayana Health, we offer advanced treatment for the following heart disorders:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
                    <li>Myocardial infarction</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.narayanahealth.org/coronary-artery-disease/"
                            style="color:#f06850;">Coronary Artery Disease</a></li>
                    <li>Angina Pectoris</li>
                    <li>Cardiomyopathy</li>
                    <li>Heart Arrhythmia</li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.narayanahealth.org/heart-failure/" style="color:#f06850;">Heart Failure</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>Atheroma</li>
                    <li>Atrial Fibrillation among many others</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>We at Narayana Health believe in providing the best to our patients, which is why we offer the most
                    advanced treatment and facilities to our patients, some of which include the following:</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Diagnostic Electrophysiology studies
                        <p>The electrophysiology study is a test conducted to examine the electrical system or activity
                            of the heart and detect any abnormal heartbeats or arrhythmia. The electrical activity is
                            measured by advancing catheters and wire electrodes through blood vessels that enter the
                            heart. We take every possible care to ensure that your test remains uncomplicated. Several
                            medications may be given to the patients intravenously to sedate the part but they don't
                            otherwise pose a threat to your body. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Catheter Ablation of Arrhythmias
                        <p>This procedure uses radiofrequency energy to destroy a small part of the heart tissue
                            responsible for causing rapid and irregular heartbeats. Catheter ablation is used for the
                            treatment of <a href="https://www.narayanahealth.org/irregular-heartbeat"
                                style="color:#f06850;">arrhythmias</a> only when medicines are ineffective or not
                            tolerated. At Narayana, the best cardiology hospital in India, Catheter ablation is
                            sometimes done through open-heart surgery, but it's often done using catheters, to make the
                            procedure less invasive and shortening recovery times.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Lead Extraction
                        <p>A lead helps to deliver the energy from a <a
                                href="https://www.narayanahealth.org/heart-pacemaker/"
                                style="color:#f06850;">pacemaker</a> or ICD to the heart muscle. During lead extraction,
                            one or more leads are removed from inside the heart. However, the leads that are placed
                            outside the heart during open surgery can’t be removed during the lead extraction procedure.
                            A patient might need lead extraction if</p>
                        <p>- there is any damage to the inside or outside of a lead</p>
                        <p>- formation of scar tissue at the tip of the lead</p>
                        <p>- infection at the site of the device or the lead</p>
                        <p>- blockage of the vein by a clot or scar tissue</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Cardioversion
                        <p>This medical procedure is performed to restore the normal heart rhythm in patients with
                            arrhythmias. Cardioversion is done by sending electric shocks to the heart with the help of
                            electrodes placed on the heart. It is a scheduled procedure that needs to be performed in a
                            hospital.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Resynchronization therapy for heart failure
                        <p>The resynchronisation therapy is done to implant a device in the chest to facilitate the
                            contraction of the heart’s chambers in a more organised and efficient way. The device is
                            called a biventricular pacemaker, and it delivers electrical signals to the lower chambers
                            of the heart to maximise the amount of blood being pumped out.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>Transtelephonic arrhythmia monitoring
                        <p>Also known as an event recorder, transtelephonic arrhythmia monitoring is done with the help
                            of a pager-sized device that enables patients to record their arrhythmias as they occur.</p>
                        <p>It is done mostly when the electrocardiogram does not give your physician enough information
                            about your heartbeats. By wearing a device for an extended period, irregularities in your
                            heartbeat can be more easily detected.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="https://www.narayanahealth.org/heart-pacemaker/" style="color:#f06850;">Pacemaker</a>
                        and implantable cardioverter defibrillators and follow-up treatment
                        <p>Pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators are devices designed to treat
                            dysrhythmias and address ventricular tachyarrhythmias. ICDs have revolutionized the
                            treatment of patients at risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular tachyarrhythmias. A
                            permanent pacemaker is an implanted device that provides electrical stimuli and causes
                            cardiac contraction. All modern ICDs also work as pacemakers.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>With the primary goal of patient comfort and complete cure in mind, we at Narayana Health work
                    tirelessly and dedicatedly to provide the best care to our patients.</p>

                <p>Narayana Health is where you find brilliance and treatment expertise combined with the human touch.

                <h3>Recovery from cardiology diseases: what does an expert do?</h3>
                <p>Post-surgery, patients will be shifted to the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) for observation for a couple
                    of days. Depending on the patient's heart and conditions, they will be sent to their home for 3-4
                    weeks of recovery. The recovery period will be extended if it's a severe heart cardiology surgery or
                    treatment.</p>

                <p>Treatment for a cardiology patient doesn't end at the hospital. At home, patients have to do simple,
                    positive steps to recover from heart disease and reduce their chance of having more problems in the
                    future.</p>

                <p>Common precautions that are given by our experts to every adult, on a fitness note, are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set recovery goals and priorities with regards to their physical health and emotional state.
                    </li>
                    <li>Wake up on time and perform regular light works around their house</li>
                    <li>Take medicines, on time, in the prescribed dosage</li>
                    <li>See a cardiologist on time and keep up with your cardiac rehabilitation regularly.</li>
                    <li>If you have had surgery, take care of the wounds and eat a balanced healthy diet.</li>
                    <li>Follow physical exercises that are advised by your physiotherapist or cardiologist team.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A cardiac attack may occur without any alarming signs, so you must consult a cardiologist every now
                    and then to get the best heart treatment in India. However, look at the following signs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Chest pain
                    </li>
