                            <h3>Gynecologic Cancers</h3>
                            <p>Gynecologic cancers begin to spread within a women’s pelvis area, which is below the
                                abdomen and in between the hip bones. Most women are affected by cervical cancer,
                                ovarian cancer, and uterus (endometrial) gynecological cancer. The other less common
                                gynecologic cancers include cancer in the vulva, vagina, gestational trophoblastic
                                tumors and fallopian tube.</p>
                            <p><b>Cervical cancer</b></p>
                            <p>Cervical cancer is cancer that occurs in the cervix cells (neck of the womb), the
                                lower part of the woman’s womb that connects with the vagina. <a
                                    href="https://www.narayanahealth.org/cervical-cancer/"
                                    style="color:#f06850;">Cervical cancer</a> affects women primarily aged 30 - 45
                                years. It rarely affects women under the age of 25 years.</p>

                            <p>Cervical cancer is caused by a strait of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), a sexually
                                transmitted infection. When a human body is exposed to an HPV, the immune system
                                prevents the virus from doing damage. A small percentage of women’s bodies keep the
                                virus for a longer time and contribute to the process of creating cancer cells.</p>

                            <p>Group of HPV viruses spreads through skin to skin sexual contact, usually clears up
                                on its own without any treatment. Our gynecologic oncology doctors provide screening
                                and vaccines to reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer and protect you from
                                HPV infection.</p>
                            <p><b>Key signs of cervical cancer</b></p>
                            <p>Generally, early age of cervical cancer doesn't show any symptoms or signs. It starts
                                to show signs at an advanced stage, some women do not experience any symptoms of
                                cervical cancer. It's very important for a woman to attend cervical symptoms
                                screening tests appointments.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Vaginal bleeding is the main symptom to be noticeable, it occurs after sexual
                                    intercourse. You have to take notice of any unnecessary bleeding any other time,
                                    between periods or after menopause.</li>
                                <li>Bloody or watery vaginal discharge with a foul odor.</li>
                                <li>Pelvic pain or discomfort during intercourse.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Only a small proportion of women are vulnerable to HPV infections, we suggest
                                screening tests for abnormal vaginal bleeding. Narayana health care gynecologists
                                perform a colposcopy test to examine the abnormalities of cervix cells and diagnose
                                the cancer cells.</p>
                            <p><b>Ovarian cancer</b></p>
                            <p>Ovarian cancer is a type of gynecological cancer that occurs in ovaries. Ovarian
                                cancer can affect women of any age, but it mostly occurs in women ageing between
                                50-60 years. The female reproductive system has two ovaries, one on each side of the
                                uterus. They produce the eggs, estrogen, and progesterone hormones.</p>
                            <p>Many times, ovarian cancer goes undetected until it spreads within the abdomen and
                                pelvis. Early-stage ovarian cancer can be treated successfully if it spreads only on
                                ovarian areas. At the last stage, ovarian cancer is more strenuous to treat and is
                                fatal.</p>

                                pelvic organ where the fetal process takes place. Endometrial cancer or uterine
                                cancer begins in the lining (endometrium) of the uterus cell. Uterine sarcoma cancer
                                also begins in the uterus, but less common as compared to endometrial cancer.</p>

                            <p>Uterine cancer affects women of any age, and it’s more common among post-menopausal

                            <h3>Innovative treatment for gynecologic cancer</h3>
                            <p>Depending on the kind of cancer and its spreading areas, gynecologic cancer can be
                                treated in several ways. Narayana Health care’s gynecologic oncology surgeons do a
                                full range of effective and innovative treatments like complex laparoscopic,
                                fertility-sparing surgery, robotic approaches, and chemotherapy to treat women with
                                gynecologic cancer.</p>
                            <p><b>Advanced laparoscopic surgery</b></p>
                            <p>The laparoscopic technique is a minimally invasive and effective technique to treat
                                cancer tissues. This treatment allows patients to stay in hospitals for less period,
                                less discomfort and recovery period is shorter compared to other treatment methods.
                                Our gynecologic oncology experts use the laparoscopic technique efficiently to
                                remove damaged cells in pelvic organs.</p>

                            <p>The Gynecologic doctors remove damaged cells in an operation and have an advantage in
                                a laparoscopy method. This approach allows specialists to operate with increased
                                accuracy and precision with less trauma to tissues surrounding cancer cells.</p>
                            <p><b>Intraoperative radiation therapy</b></p>
                            <p>This radiation therapy uses high radiation x-rays to treat cancer. This advanced
                                technology is used to treat people who might have no other choice but to remove
                                damaged tissues from the original tumor site. Our surgeons use high-end equipment to
                                give high doses of radiation directly to the tumor site during surgery. Narayana
                                health care is one of the best medical institutions to provide this treatment option
                                in India.</p>
                            <p><b>Chemotherapy</b></p>
                            <p>This treatment method uses a special kind of medicine to shrink or remove cancer. The
                                drugs used in this method can be pills or medicine you take regularly, given in your
                                veins. The direct chemotherapy technique is given into the abdomen to treat ovarian
                                cancers.</p>
                            <p><b>Hormone therapy</b></p>
                            <p>This method uses hormones to prevent the recurrence of various kinds of gynecologic
                                cancers.</p>
                            <h3>Gynecologic cancer diagnosis</h3>
                            <p>To diagnose gynecologic cancer depending on the type and location of cancer the tools
                                and tests are performed, other factors including patient’s medical history and
